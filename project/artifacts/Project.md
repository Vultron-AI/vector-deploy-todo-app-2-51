# Team Task Tracker

## What This Is

A simple task management app for teams where each task has a clear owner. Team members see only their assigned tasks, creating accountability by making ownership explicit and visible.

## Core Value

Every task has one clear owner who is responsible for completing it.

## Target Users

Team members or employees who need to track and complete tasks assigned to them. They face the problem of tasks falling through the cracks because no one is clearly responsible. They need a simple way to see what they're accountable for and mark work as done.

## Context

The entrepreneur's team currently struggles with accountability — tasks get lost because ownership is unclear. This app solves that by making every task explicitly assigned to one person. The goal is simplicity: no complex features, just clear ownership and completion tracking.

## Key Features
